//  An ASISpaceTimeMap records the predicted position of objects in the future
//  When objects plan a route, they record where they think they're going to be at each time step
//  This allows objects to co-operatively path find - they won't be able to travel to positions that other units have already reserved for that point in time
//  As game time advances, incrementTime effectively throws away the most recent time step to make space for a future one
//  In implementation, a space time map is an array of positions on the map, with a new array for each time step
